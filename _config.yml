about_content: |
  Hi, I’m Seyeon Choi, a PhD student at Seoul National University, affiliated with the Vision & Learning Lab.
  My research focuses on building generalizable embodied agents, with particular interest in grounding, interaction, and decision-making in complex environments.

  I am currently exploring how large language models can move beyond static reasoning to act robustly as agents, especially under distribution shifts and unseen environments.
  My long-term goal is to develop agents that integrate symbolic reasoning with reinforcement learning to enable flexible, human-like behavior across diverse settings.

  I have research experience across vision, language, and agent systems through internships and projects at multiple labs, and I enjoy translating theoretical ideas into practical, scalable systems.

        title: Generalizable Web Agent (Capstone Design II)
        quote: >
          Improving generalization of web agents to unseen websites via exemplar-based memory.
        description: |
          Designed a web agent that improves performance on unseen websites by constructing an exemplar memory during an exploration phase and leveraging it at inference time.
          This project focuses on robustness and cross-website generalization beyond in-domain training.
          Currently in progress as part of Software Capstone Design (II).

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Outside of my research, I enjoy activities that help me recharge and stay curious.
      - Cooking, especially Asian cuisine  
      - Exploring new restaurants and cafés  
      - Collecting and enjoying fragrances, with a preference for citrus, floral, and soft musk notes  
      - Reading books in my spare time  

      Below is a photo I took during one of my walks.
